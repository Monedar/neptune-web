## Platforms

- [Web](#Web) <span class="badge badge-danger">Ready for development</span>

## Best practices

<h3 class="text-success">Do</h3>

- Use a drawer to let the user perform a single step task such as add or edit an entity. The task is performed in the context from where it is triggered
- Use a drawer to show extended and multimedia information without taking the user away from the context where it is relevant
- Use a [Default](#Default) drawer to display information which does not include user actions other than dismissing the drawer
- Use a default drawer with inline actions when you want the user to scroll through the whole content before reaching the main action
- Use a drawer with [fixed footer](#FixedFooter) when the user is not required to scroll through all the contents before accessing the main action
- Use a drawer in [drill down](#DrillDown) view to provide extra information. The drill down view is triggered from any of the previous cases. The user can navigate back to parent.

<h3 class="text-danger">Don't</h3>

- Do not use a drawer if your task involves more than one step. Use a [Flow](Flow) instead
- Do not use a drawer to ask for confirmation. Use a [Modal](Modal) confirmation dialog instead.

<h3>Dismissal</h3>

- The drawer is dismissed by clicking on the close button in the header, pressing the Esc key or clicking on the dimmed background
- State of the drawer is maintained independently of its content. If the user retriggers the drawer, it should open in the last shown state, including user-entered information.
