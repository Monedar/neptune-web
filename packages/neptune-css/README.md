# Neptune CSS ðŸ”±

## CSS library

This demo is deprecated [transferwise.github.io/neptune-css](https://transferwise.github.io/neptune-css/), use [https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-design-system](https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-design-system) to document the components.

## How to consume
In the `dist/` directory you can find all the components' CSS. Use them as individual components (e.g. alerts.css) or call the whole library (neptune.css).

You can use it as a dependency in your package.json:
- "neptune-css": "git+https://github.com/transferwise/neptune-css.git"

## Build the project
- npm run build
